# GameLift Multiplayer Example
Unreal Engine 4 Multiplayer example for [Amazon's GameLift service](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/?nc1=h_ls). The Multiplayer example demonstrates how to use Amazon's GameLift service and the GameLift Exposed Plugin (available on [Unreal's Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/store)).

## What is Amazon GameLift?
Amazon GameLift is a fully managed service for deploying, operating, and scaling your session-based
multiplayer game servers in the cloud. Amazon GameLift replaces the work required to host your own
game servers, including buying and setting up hardware, and managing ongoing activity, security,
storage, and performance tracking. The Amazon GameLift auto-scaling capabilities provide additional
protection from having to pay for more resources than you need, while helping to ensure that your
players can find and join games with minimal waiting.
